# Set up test environment

Assuming that the MySQL dataset and database have been setup and BLAST database
files have been installed in `tests/test_data/mysql`, the MySQL environment can
be set up by running `source tests/test_env.sh mysql`.  To use the `smalldata`
test case based on SQLite, run `source tests/test_env.sh`.
