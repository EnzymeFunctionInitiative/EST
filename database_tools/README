# Building a Database

Building a complete EFI-EST/GNT database requires a few steps as well as a bit
of manual intervention.  The first step involves downloading the files which
as of August 2017 is a process that must be user-initiated and run on the EFI
machine since the clusters don't allow access from nodes to the outside world.
Eventually that process will be moved to the datamover account/process, but at
least for now it is a manual step.

The builddb.pl script is used to create the database build directory
structure.  The structure is created for any of the following build steps.

All scripts are created in BUILD_DIR/build


## Step 1: Downloading UniProt and Interpro files

builddb.pl can be used to create a script that downloads the requisite files
and is used as follows:

    # builddb.pl -dir BUILD_DIR -download -queue efi -scheduler slurm -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE


## Step 2: Downloading ENA files

Currently this is a process that is not automatically included in the download
script build by builddb.pl.  However, there is a line at the end of the file
that gives guidance on how this might be done.  The reason that it is not
included is that the rsync takes a long time, and occasionally fails and must
be restarted.  This will be moved into the datamover process eventually.  The
download script shouldn't take more than a day to run, but the rsync of ENA
data will take several days.  The release cycle is different than UniProt and
Interpro as well, so the user will not always download ENA files.  The rsync
can be run independent of the UniProt and Interpro download and processing
jobs.


## Step 3: Process the UniProt and Interpro files

The UniProt and Interpro files need to be processed and blast'ed after being
downloaded.  To create and automatically submit scripts that will process the
downloaded files, the following command can be run:

    # builddb.pl -dir BUILD_DIR -queue efi -scheduler slurm -db-name YYYY-MM -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE


## Step 4: Process ENA files

The job that processes the ENA files is dependent on the first part of Step 3,
namely the process-downloads job file.  Once that job is completed, builddb.pl
can be used to create and start a job that processes the ENA files and builds
a tab file that can be imported into the database.  It can be run as follows:

    # builddb.pl -dir BUILD_DIR -ena-dir ENA_DIR -build-ena -queue efi -scheduler slurm -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE

This could be triggered at the end of the script that downloads (rsync) the
ENA files from biomirror and made a dependency of the process-downloads job.
If the -ena-dir option is not provided, it is assumed that the ENA files have
been downloaded to BUILD_DIR/input/ena/release.


## Step 5: Create database and import data

The final steps in building a database involve using builddb.pl to create SQL
scripts used for creating and importing the data into tables.  In order to
mitigate the risk of overwriting a database, the scripts require that the
user have created a database manually (e.g. "create database YYYY-MM" from
within MySQL).  




## Appendix A

To ONLY create a script and SQL file that will create the family_counts table
that needs to be imported into the EFI webserver mysql database:

    # builddb.pl  -dir BUILD_DIR -build-counts -config EFI_CONFIG_FILE
