#version 0.5.0  fixed a problem where one less file was created if number of sequences were around the value of np
#version 0.8.1  rewrote program to use an array of filehandles instead of chopping into parts.
#version 0.9.0  made program more generic so that it can split up any fasta file into N parts, useful for generating pdb blast info
