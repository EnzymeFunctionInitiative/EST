# Enzyme Function Initiative - Enzyme Similarity Tool
EFI-EST is a flexible pipeline which builds Sequence Similarity Networks of
proteins for the purpose of elucidating the function of enzymes. It is available
through a web tool at https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est/ and on [KBase]().
This respository contains the analysis code that these services use.

# Running the Pipelines
Please see our [documentation](docs/index.rst) for comprehensive information on using the
pipelines.

# Contributors

The EFI tools were originally created by Daniel Davidson (dbdavids@illinois.edu),
and further developed by David Slater (dslater@illinois.edu), Hunter DeMeyer
(demeyer3@illinois.edu), and Nils Oberg (noberg@illinois.edu).  Additional
contributors were Rémi Zallot, Katie Whalen, Heidi Imker, and Boris Sadkhin.
John Gerlt (j-gerlt@illinois.edu) envisioned the project and provided continual
oversight and feedback.

# Copyright and License Information

The EFI tools are copyright 2012-2024 University of Illinois and are licensed
under the GPL v3 license (see LICENSE).

Third-party tools are used in the pipelines but are not included in the
EFI source code repository, and therefore do not fall under the license and
